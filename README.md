# My-first-webpage

#### By Zach Wilson

#### A general collection of my first steps into the world of programming

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Description

An interactive collection of my earliest files. As I continue learning the fundamentals of programming, I will add more pages for users to peruse. Each one filled with different details about myself.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your Desktop
* Navigate to the top level of the directory
* Open js/index.html

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

Nothing to note as of writing this file. Still acquiring the know-how to spot bugs.
